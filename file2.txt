"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" AC/DC:

If you're having trouble with your high school head
He's giving you the blues
You want to graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do

Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me any time
Just ring 36 24 36, hey
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

You got problems in your life of love
You got a broken heart
He's double-dealin' with your best friend
That's when the teardrops start, fella

Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call
Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball, hey

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, yeah

Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts

Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back door man, hey

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, yeah

Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT
Done dirt cheap
Neckties, contracts, high voltage
Done dirt cheap
